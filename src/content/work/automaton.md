# Cellular automaton

This is around 4 years old, but I really enjoyed building interactive 2D canvases with paper.js. This is what got me into web development

Playing around with cellular automata I had a go at implementing these in a hexagonal grid instead of the standard matrix

- paper.js
- classic matrix automata https://webs.wonday.eu/html/paper_cellular.html
