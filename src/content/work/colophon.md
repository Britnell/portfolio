# Colophon Website

At MadeByOn.com I worked for several months on the new colophon site.
This was a large project with 4-6 devs + design + QA.

Fully configurable through headless cms, this site had an advanced set of components so the client could still customise and build any new layouts that they wanted to. A lot of time was spent crafting a set of components that was both highly customisable but not overly bloated and complex.

- react & next
- storyblock headless cms
- components encapsulation & abstractions
- css modules & sass
- css variables for themeing
- jira & git issues
