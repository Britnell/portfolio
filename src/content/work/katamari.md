# Interactive Portfolio - Katamari Game

I wanted something fun and interactive for my portfolio. Then i had this idea to take all these keywords (buzzword), and instead of slapping them on a page, render them in 3D and make a katamari game where you have to collect them.

my first larger thing built with three js. first proof of concept really, needs a bit more time to turn into a fun game, add more objects etc.

Built using
- three.js 
- react-three fiber & rapier
- [Code on github](https://github.com/Britnell/katamari)
