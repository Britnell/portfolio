# Kolam Generator

This is around 4 years old, but I really enjoyed building interactive 2D canvases with paper.js. This is what got me into web development

Kolam is a type of geometric pattern traditonally drawn on the floor by the entrance in india.
A lot of these feature this grid of twisted lines, so for fun a random generator for kolam patterns.
Randomly generated with a variety of parameters.
