# Kolam Generator

This is EST 2018, I really enjoyed building interactive 2D canvases with paper.js, this is what got me into web development

Kolam is a type of geometric pattern traditonally drawn on the floor by the entrance in india.
A lot of these feature this grid of twisted lines, so for fun a random generator for kolam patterns.
Randomly generated with a variety of parameters.

- paper.js
