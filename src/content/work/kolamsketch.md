# Kolam Drawing

This is EST 2018, I really enjoyed building interactive 2D canvases with paper.js, this is what got me into web development

Kolam is a type of geometric pattern traditonally drawn on the floor by the entrance in india.
A lot of these feature this grid of twisted lines

Draw your own!
