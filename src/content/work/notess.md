# Notesss - Markdown++

i wanted a specific type of notes app for daily journal + habit tracker that i didnt find anywhere : 
- daily markdown notes for each day
- habit tracking
- todos lists
- links
- #hashtags and @mentions

to be really flexible i decided to store everything as string, markdown, but implemented my own markdown parsing so i could add features. as no existing markdown parser let me do this nicely

login with github oauth only, because developers love markdown

stack : 
- astro
- preact
- turso / sqlite, drizzle
- better auth - github oauth
