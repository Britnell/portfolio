# Spotify live key information

The spotify api are great, i enjoy playing with them & building stuff.

They actually provide full song analysis data on beats & tone analysis. So I built a little web app that displays this info in a vertical piano-like layout & syncs with the live song position.

Due to a bug in spotify api (probably intentional) the precise playback time can only be estimated so it is sadly not 100% accurate.

## Tech :

- Astro SPA
- spotify api
- preact
- tailwind
