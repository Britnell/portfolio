# Pushbullet PWA clone

I recently switched to iOS and was frustrated that there no longer was pushbullet.
(I was sending myself things in whatsapp etc.)
So I built myself a simple pushbullet clone, but its open for signup & usage

## Tech :

- Astro SSR
- installable PWA
- turso SQLite db + drizzle orm
- self rolled basic auth
- preact (react replace)
- react query for async state management
