# Audio Sampler

I wanted to try and build an audio sampler in the browser. I love playing with samplers so I liked the idea of having one thats always available. For fun & practice. I wanted to try out the web audio api, and see how far I could get with those, and how performance it would be, and it's pretty decent! it's responsive, with a small enough delay that you can play around and make some loops.

## Tech :

- web audio api
- react
- astro & tailwind (of course)
