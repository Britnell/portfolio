# Scroll Animations

I'm into CSS animations.
& I'm into CSS variables.

So I made a reusable react hook that uses intersection observer to add css variables that describe the scroll parameter of an element.
One reusable hook for when I don't want to load an entire animation library just for 1 or 2 animations
