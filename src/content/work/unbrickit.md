# Un-brick-it!

This combined a few things I wanted
- a fancy alarm clock with nice different fonts
- hourly chimes, alarms, timers
- something to do with old phones

but it grew, and can even do : 
- habit tracking
- play radio
- play random podcast episode

pretty awesome [what web can do](https://whatwebcando.today/), at least on Android, as apple really hates PWA.
with modern web api we can even go fullscreen, keep the screen awake, read the time with TTS
